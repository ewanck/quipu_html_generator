0,1320,1412,67,159,2880,I am Francisca Quispe Pontenciano
1,1474,1539,221,286,2880,from the village of Ulpamache
2,1474,1590,315,431,2880,I was also affected by the time of violence
3,1590,1683,431,524,2880,when they were doing the operations to sterilize people. 
4,1590,1675,524,609,2880,The sterilizations came with tricks. 
5,1590,1631,619,660,2880,"They insisted, "
6,1624,1673,675,724,2880,they tricked us 
7,1624,1686,749,811,2880,"that we couldn't have any more family,"
8,1624,1665,811,852,2880, that our families were too big already
9,1665,1771,852,958,2880,and we wouldn't be able to support them in the future. 
10,1664,1752,967,1055,2880, I was sterilized when I was 25 years of age. 
11,1664,1711,1066,1113,2880,And then they said
12,1711,1787,1113,1189,2880,'Where are you going to leave such a big family?'
13,1711,1798,1198,1285,2880,and they said that there was a new law
14,1711,1781,1285,1355,2880,that said that we had to have the operation. 
15,1774,1851,1355,1432,2880,"That we should take the opportunity, because the operation was free."
16,1774,1868,1432,1526,2880,"Then we â€¦  In my case I said no, "
17,1774,1845,1526,1597,2880,"because our work here in the countryside is hard,"
18,1842,1906,1597,1661,2880,"that we live from our fields,"
19,1841,1894,1661,1714,2880,we work with wool. 
20,1882,1965,1714,1797,2880,"Here in the countryside we carry wood,"
21,1882,1934,1797,1849,2880,"from our ranch in our saddlebag, "
22,1927,2015,1849,1937,2880,and we wouldn't be able to live like that anymore.
23,1930,2002,28,100,2880,"And we said we would think about it, "
24,1931,1994,100,163,2880,we went home 
25,1989,2050,170,231,2880,"and the nurses kept looking for us,"
26,1992,2075,231,314,2880,"wherever we were, as if we were delinquents."
27,1991,2016,345,370,2880,Wherever we were.
28,2016,2102,370,456,2880,They even told us to do it without telling our husbands.
29,2019,2099,456,536,2880,"'Your husband won't accept, he probably wants you to be filled with children' ... "
30,2019,2047,536,564,2880,so many things. 
31,2047,2101,564,618,2880,And that's how they forced us.
32,2047,2109,628,690,2880,They forced us because we were weak
33,2047,2136,690,779,2880,they forced us to get sterilized
34,2046,2098,784,836,2880,"As we say in our land, "
35,2098,2182,836,920,2880,they treated us like animals
36,2097,2202,920,1025,2880,"They sent us home without treatment for anything, "
37,2096,2134,1025,1063,2880,nothing at all.
38,2126,2207,1064,1145,2880,"Now they have left us incapacitated, "
39,2128,2158,1145,1175,2880,"with half a life,"
40,2158,2222,1175,1239,2880,we can't do anything now.
41,2158,2213,1239,1294,2880,They affected every part of us.
42,2158,2246,41,129,2880,"What this government, what Fujimorism did. "
43,2159,2297,129,267,2880,"If he did not want to see so many Peruvian mothers,"
44,2159,2214,267,322,2880,so many people in Peru.
45,2205,2289,330,414,2880,"well, it would have been better that he killed us, "
46,2264,2331,414,481,2880,so that we wouldn't have to live in this terrible situation 
47,2267,2308,481,522,2880,of endless suffering.
48,2301,2386,530,615,2880,How will we end up in the future?
49,2300,2375,622,697,2880,"Us mothers are on our knees, and it will be even worse,  "
50,2301,2394,697,790,2880,because we can't work.
51,2301,2383,829,911,2880,"This damned government, what he did."
52,2347,2408,919,980,2880,Now if he is asking for...
53,2347,2387,980,1020,2880,"for pardon,"
54,2370,2436,1020,1086,2880,as for me I hope he dries up in prison.
55,2436,2516,1086,1166,2880,"He left so many people incapacitated here, "
56,2436,2465,1166,1195,2880,"many innocent people,"
57,2465,2506,1195,1236,2880,illiterate people. 
58,2499,2576,1244,1321,2880,He left us invalid.
59,2499,2685,1331,1517,2880,That is the testimony I give you now.
