6,1972,2051,619,698,2880,"that day when that committee came, "
7,2051,2171,698,818,2880,it was like being in a prison.
8,2051,2107,818,874,2880,"They closed the gate,  "
9,2107,2237,874,1004,2880,and when some women saw how others were crying with the pain
10,2051,2102,1004,1055,2880,"they wanted to leave, "
11,2040,2103,1055,1118,2880,but we were already inside and they wouldn't let us leave. 
12,2151,2236,1118,1203,2880,They took me inside 
13,2236,2353,1203,1320,2880,and then they brought me to do the sterilisation 
14,2353,2428,1320,1395,2880,and gave me the anaesthetic.

16,2489,2552,1456,1519,2880,as they started cutting me 
17,2552,2590,1519,1557,2880,and it hurt …
18,2587,2678,1557,1648,2880,I heard them saying 
19,2678,2754,1648,1724,2880,'she's is pregnant'
20,2678,2711,1724,1757,2880,"Then I, "
21,2711,2852,1757,1898,2880,"because God didn't want my baby to die at that moment, "
22,2711,2780,1898,1967,2880,"I said to them: 'I don't want you to remove my baby, "
23,2780,2867,1967,2054,2880,"I'd rather die with my baby, "
24,2821,2880,2054,2113,2880,leave my baby there.'
25,2711,2775,21,85,2880,"I woke up with tremendous pain, "
26,2775,2838,85,148,2880,the IV line had come out of my arm. 
27,2823,2880,148,205,2880,"Me with tremendous pain, "
28,2760,2880,205,325,2880,and they threw us out and told us we all had to go home.
29,2760,2866,325,431,2880,"I was 3 months pregnant when they did it, "
30,2719,2810,431,522,2880,I suffered with my little child like this 
31,2810,2863,522,575,2880,until 7 months.
32,2698,2746,575,623,2880,"I wasn't at all well, "
33,2746,2794,623,671,2880,the belly was very swollen 
34,2740,2801,671,732,2880,"and the doctor was checking on me,"
35,2736,2822,732,818,2880,and he told me it was better if I went to Piura 
36,2822,2879,818,875,2880,because here they wouldn't be able to...
37,2808,2880,875,947,2880,"I went to say goodbye to my children,"
38,2805,2880,947,1022,2880, I had 7 small children.
39,2764,2835,1022,1093,2880, I said goodbye to them to go to Piura
40,2797,2864,1093,1160,2880,"They took me to my village, Rodeo Pampa"
41,2789,2880,1160,1251,2880,around 1 in the morning 
42,2789,2880,1260,1351,2880,I woke up with a tremendous pain and
43,2822,2871,1383,1432,2880,I stood up 
44,2799,2880,1432,1513,2880,"and huge gush of blood came out of me, "
45,2799,2832,1513,1546,2880,like a haemorrhage.
46,2799,2817,1546,1564,2880,And …
47,2790,2842,1575,1627,2880,"around 6, 7 in the morning, "
48,2831,2875,1627,1671,2880,"I don't remember much, "
49,2791,2880,1671,1760,2880,but the midwife had already helped me give birth. 
50,2791,2839,1760,1808,2880,"My son died, "
51,2839,2879,1808,1848,2880,and I was really unwell 
52,2801,2880,1848,1927,2880,and I'm still really unwell. 
53,2802,2880,30,108,2880,"This is why us peasant women, "
54,2802,2862,108,168,2880,because we were illiterate
55,2825,2878,168,221,2880,they did what they wanted to us.
56,2802,2873,221,292,2880,But now we say that these things 
57,2783,2880,292,389,2880,that have damaged all the women in this area
58,2783,2871,389,477,2880,must not happen again. 
59,2814,2880,490,556,2880,The women feel awful.
60,2805,2880,571,646,2880,And we have this experience 
61,2765,2864,646,745,2880,and we won't allow other young women 
62,2721,2803,745,827,2880,"to go through it,"
63,2792,2880,827,915,2880,we won't allow this to happen again. 
64,2797,2843,915,961,2880,That is why 
65,2762,2880,969,1087,2880,we are asking for women's rights. 
66,2762,2793,1087,1118,2880,Thank you.
