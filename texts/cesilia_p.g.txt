My name is Cesilia Peña Guerrero from the village Ingano Grande in Sondorillo. I was ligated when I my daughter had one month. I had gone to the medical centre and they didn't want to give me the certificate to register her at Sondorillo. They didn't give it to me, they said that I should get ligated, or my husband but he didn't want to. He said it was harder to get men to have the surgery, that it was better if they did me. I didn’t want to, I was afraid, afraid of the ligation. And so they encouraged me, they said they would help us with something. And then they brought us to Huancabamba, I had the surgery there and then they never remembered, with nothing, nothing. And that’s why we are here now since the ladies have come, we want perhaps some support so that we can maintain ourselves. I have my children at school and I can hardly work, my belly hurts, my brain hurts, my head hurts y I don't live well.
