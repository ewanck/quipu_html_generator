Herbalinda Quinde García. Our town, Sondorillo is poor and very dry. There they animated us to do that… what's the name, the ligation. When you have to work, when there’s no wage and the husband is inattentive, one has to find the way to do the work. I had 7 children, and the 7 of them were small and I had to work. When the husband disregards you and you don't have a wage you have to think and work hard. And up there is dry, there’s no water, so they told me not too have too many (children) because I worked hard and could fall ill, and that’s true. We are all frail now, that’s the only thing, nothing more.
