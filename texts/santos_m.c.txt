I’m Santos Manchay Castillo from the village of Quilán that belongs to the province of Huancabamba. 
I’ve had surgery the year 1999, when an operation campaign arrived, and I had surgery because I had 8 children already. I went to the hospital and the nurses told me that I had too much family, and when and I see that I’ve got operated thinking I would be ok and we are not ok. All the women that are ligated are really bad and that’s why we are here today in this meeting thanks to the ladies that have come to learn and take out from us the shame. Because us from here Huancabamba we are not made to talk, that’s why we are grateful that they teach us. I can say that we haven’t end up all right, we are all ill. That’s why we are asking for help, it maybe can be a medicine or some help to sustain us until God asks for us. And here we are at this meeting so we can push us forward. They ligated me. Now we are not ok, we are ill, all illness crash with us. We ask for some help with these ladies, we want medicine or something else that could help us, thanks.
