Marta Peña Santos… I’m Angelica Peña Santos. I’m thankful that we are here in a meeting with all the friends, that support us with a grain of sand. Because we are poor, orphan from father and mother, and my husband also had an accident because of the government. I was left alone with my children and there’s no one to support me, no one to help. Two of my children grew up and left, tow of them died and now I’m alone. A poor woman, one-handed because of that ligation. That’s why I want support.
